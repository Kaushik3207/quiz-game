Hi, Kaushik this side, I am going to keep this short.
Basically this was my first project after self-learning python as a language. I often struggled with the while loop, which is why I decided to make this project
in the first place. I tried my best to use the while loop in the main code and succeded after a few trial and errors.

I am happy and excited to share this even if as a baby step in my journey!!

Thank you for reading so far, Have a look at the project and let me know any criticism regarding it!
