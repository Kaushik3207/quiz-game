# My first python project!

Hi, Kaushik this side, I am going to keep this short.
Basically this was my first project after self-learning python as a language. I often struggled with the while loop, which is why I decided to make this project
in the first place. I tried my best to use the while loop in the main code and succeded after a few trial and errors. The most difficult part was to get the scoring system to work properly and not repeat the same question again and again.

### I referred to the following <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGjplNEQ1it8-0CmoljS5yeV-GlKSUEt0">playlist
### by ApnaCollege religiously to learn python basics, after which I was able to build this project.

The project is very simple when executed, it includes three questions(customizable), and upon executing the project first gives you a set of instructions to read
and asks your name. 
After this basic introduction, the program starts and shows the questions to you and then prompts you to enter the appropriate option number to the question, right 
answer earns you 2 points, wrong one tells you the right answer and moves on to the next question.
I am happy and excited to share this even if as a baby step in my journey.

One can easily test out this code on their own computers by simply downloading the quizGame.py file in this repository and running it on any code editor or IDE.

### Thank you!
for reading so far, Have a look at the project and let me know any criticism regarding it!
